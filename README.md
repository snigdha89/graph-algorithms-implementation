# graph-algorithms-implementation

The enclosed file “person_knows_person.csv” has relationships. This file is a simulation of a graph dataset and each row presents two nodes that are connected to each other.
I implemented : 
- Dijkstra and A* to find the shortest path in the graph.
- Prim and Kruskal to find the Minimum Spanning Tree from two arbitrary nodes one will be the source one node will be target.
- Page rank and HITS algorithm to order the graph nodes based on their importance.
- Louvain or Leiden for community detection , and visualization of the results.
